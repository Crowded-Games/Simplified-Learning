## Reporting a Vulnerability

Now, JUST IN CASE THERE IS ONE, either that the update is soo terrible that the security of the application breaks, or someone put in a internet feature...

...you can give a pull request to remove it. Not only that, but contact a prolific developer to get it implemented as fast as possible.
