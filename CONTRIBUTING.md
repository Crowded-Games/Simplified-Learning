# Welcome to the Contributing section

good stuff. Lets see what we got here...

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are when someone wants to edit the files. Here are some requirements for it to work:

1. You should specify what were you exactly changing and how your current changes help with that change.
2. None of your changes require the internet. This might seem wierd, but I started this project to go against Quizlet, and my internet was slow. This, in turn, resulted in a slow studying experience.
3. If it fixes any issues, specify them. If it implements any ideas, specify them.

## Issues

This is where the majority of pull requests go to find out what to fix or implement. Here are some requirements for the issue to be resolved quickly:
1. Specify what it is and how to recreate it.
2. If you can (this is optional), specify what could be the problem.

## Feature requests

Lastly, feature requests. This will be in issues or discussions. If its good, we can try and implement it, but if this project gets too big we might need to tone down feature requests.
