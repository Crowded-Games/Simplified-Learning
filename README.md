 Im trying again.

 I am going to start by saying if you want to contribute to this Github repository, PLEASE DO! The more people that contribute to this to make it more better... the better!

 You might be wondering why I am saying I am trying again. I have done this once, but it was sub-par.

 Star this repository for more fun stuff added to this!
